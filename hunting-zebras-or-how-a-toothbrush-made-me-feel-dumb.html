            <p>Anyone who follows me to Twitter will probably remember that I've had
some issues with my Samsung Galaxy S2 ever since I upgraded from 2.6
&nbsp;Froyo to 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich. There are many posts in forums all
about the battery and stability issues that have plagued this update and
I have probably read all of them.</p>
<p>I also had some fun times with enabling encryption on the device due to
it presenting a blank screen while it was performing the encryption
rather that something that would let you know it was actually doing
something.</p>
<p>With all the above issues I was hoping that the next update to arrive on
my phone would solve all of my problems, so when Samsung made 4.0.4
available I installed it as soon as I could. Oh, and thanks Samsung for
using OTA for the 4.0.4 update and not that piece of crapware you call
Kies.</p>
<p>I bet you're wondering where the African wildlife and dental&nbsp;hygiene
products are? Don't worry, they're coming.</p>
<p>I ran 4.0.4 for a few days and was very happy that my battery was
lasting longer, without the infamous &quot;Android OS&quot; usage that was killing
it last time. The phone was more stable, in the sense that it actually
kept running instead of overheating and crashing twice a day. I'm also
sure that it made me more attractive to the opposite sex, everything is
coming up Ian...</p>
<p>Until I got a phone call. I don't know if I'm typical of a smartphone
user in that I use my phone for 90% data such as email, IM, social
networking, 8% SMS and about 2% voice as I make and receive phone calls
quite rarely. Recently I have used voice a lot more as I am in the
process of changing jobs to a new employer. This call was from my new
boss. He sounded like he was verrrry verrry far away. The volume was so
quiet that I assumed he was either using a speaker phone or hiding under
a bed because Liam Neeson was hunting him. I punched the volume up
button but he was still almost inaudible. I managed to make it though
the phone call, and I just assumed that his phone was at fault...</p>
<p>Until I got another phone call from my Wife, she also sounded very
far away. I know she never uses speaker phones and has done nothing to
draw the eye of Liam Neeson so at that point I figured there was
something wrong with my handset, and the only thing to chance recently
was the OS.</p>
<p>I made a few calls to my network providers automated system and they
were also quiet, so it is not just incoming calls that are a problem.
Google is a wealth of information on this, apparently there were loads
of problems like this on 2.6 and the solution was to enter a handset
configuration mode and manually set the in call volume. I key in the
special code and get to the configuration but the audio menu is blocked
out so I can't make any changes. At this point I'm getting annoyed, why
can't they test these updates before they send them out?</p>
<p>I start downloading apps that give access to &quot;hidden&quot; volume sliders,
but all of them are set to maximum, I take a look at the internal logs
and can't spot anything that might be causing the problem. The only
thing I haven't done is a factory re-set. I hate doing these as it
always takes me weeks to get my phone running just as I like it but at
this point I&nbsp;<em>need&nbsp;</em>a phone that actually works as a phone. I bite
the bullet and factory re-set the phone, selecting the option to back up
all of my settings. 10 minutes later my phone is back to its ugly-ass
default config, but at least all my settings have been preserved. I make
a phone call to my network ... and it's really quiet again. Huh.</p>
<p>If you're still reading, I promise the ambulatory barcode is coming up.</p>
<p>I figure that maybe, just maybe the backup process kept a setting that
is causing my problem so I factory re-set the phone&nbsp;<em>again&nbsp;</em>without
taking a backup of any settings. Once test phone call later and it is
still quiet. F*cksocks.</p>
<p>At this point I am convinced that I've either got a hardware issue with
my earphone speaker or the software update has swapped all of my other
problems for this show stopper. I'm making a lot of calls because of my
new job, I've got to Liverpool this week to do a talk and I'm going to
need to be contactable, damn it I'm going to have to dig out my old
Desire and send this one back to Samsung for repair. This is just what I
need!</p>
<p>I Google a little more to see if anyone else has seen this problem with
4.0.4 in particular and one of the long forum threads with all the usual
&quot;Do the handset configuration mode fix...&quot; &quot;Re-set the phone, you've got
bad settings from 4.0.3&quot; &quot;Download these apps... root your phone....&quot;
had this little gem buried in the middle:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;I had this problem as well. It turned out my speaker grill was
dirty. I cleaned it and it was fine after that&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Well that's just silly. This came on suddenly after my upgrade,
it&nbsp;<em>must&nbsp;</em>be an issue with the software or a hardware failure.
Still, doesn't hurt to try right? I grab my toothbrush and give the
grill a little clean. I make a test call to my network and once agai....
hang on a second, that's loud again! I make another test call and it's
back to normal!</p>
<p>I had forgotten the lesson that I thought I had learned years ago,
before you go hunting for that rare Zebra that is causing your problem
make sure your issue isn't with that simple looking horse that been
standing there the whole time.</p>
<p>Hopefully the lesson has sunk in this time.</p>
