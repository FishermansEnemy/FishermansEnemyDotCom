<p><strong>Common risk assessment blind spots</strong></p>
<p>Wireless technologies have become commonplace in the last few decades,
everything with a battery seems to have an IP stack and an antenna.
Ubiquitous connectivity allows us access to &nbsp;the whole of human
knowledge with a simple Google search. If an organisation&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;provide
the infrastructure to access the internet then they might be thought of
as backwards and out of touch with modern business methods. There has
been a lot written on the subject of WiFi security and many lessons have
been learned since the good old days of WEP “encryption”, but there are
still things organisations need to think about before deploying this
kind of technology.</p>
<div class="section" id="wpa2-is-secure-right">
<h2>WPA2 is secure, right?</h2>
<p>Yes, WPA2 is pretty secure and if someone is looking to have a play with
your access points then seeing that in their favorite scanning tool will
probably have them looking elsewhere. When I am tasked with assessing
the security of a wireless installation then use of WPA2 is not in
itself enough for me to give the thumbs up. You see, when WPA2 is used
with a pre-shared key there is the possibility that whomever set it up
did not create a complex enough key. It is a simple matter to observe
the wireless network traffic until you see a device authenticating to
the access point, once this happens and you observe the 4 way handshake
you can feed this into a tool like aircrack-ng along with a word list.
If the network admin picked a dictionary word, or a dictionary word with
some “clever” character substitutions then you can usually recover the
pre-shared key in a day or so. An attacker can boost their chances of
obtaining the key by seeding the word list with words that are closely
linked to the organisation they are attacking. They simply download the
entire company website, pull out every unique word they find and add
them to the usual word list.</p>
<p>As you can see from the above, it is imperative that the key you select
be as random and as long as possible to help mitigate this kind of
attack. The problem this gives you is the same as with any other
password complexity requirement. The more secure it is, the more likely
it is to be written down where someone who should not know it can find
it. You also have the added headache of distributing the key to the
legitimate users of the network.</p>
<p>What a lot of network administrators fail to think about is what happens
when they key is compromised, for example if a wireless device is lost,
stolen or breached by viruses or malware. Once your key is out of your
control then you need to make sure that it is changed and a new key
distributed to all of your users. In my experience this rarely happens,
and it is usually a reason for abandoning the pre-shared key model and
&nbsp;looking at enterprise level controls using 802.1x.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="its-just-a-guest-network">
<h2>It’s just a guest network</h2>
<p>A lot of organisations have secure 802.1x wireless infrastructures for
their staff to use for corporate LAN access but decide that it would be
nice for visitors to be able to get internet access without having to
provision certificates for them and allowing them access to the
corporate LAN. This is very convenient for guests, but as we shall see
there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before you roll
something like this out.</p>
<p>Firstly, wireless does not respect the walls of your building the way
that your wired infrastructure does. A 2.4GHz WiFi network can usually
be observed from the car park of an office building as well as other
floors of a building that may not be under your organisations control.
When you implement your infrastructure take care with antenna type and
placement to minimise the amount you radiate to the outside world by
using directional antennas and turning down the transmission power on
your access points. If a network is radiating too much power in the
wrong direction then it is trivial to get access to it using a laptop's
built in network card, but someone who wanted to take advantage of your
generous offer of free WiFi could do so from quite a considerable
distance with something like an Alfa USB wireless card and a cheap
directional antenna, which brings me onto my second point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-are-liable-for-what-happens-on-your-network">
<h2>You are liable for what happens on your network</h2>
<p>You may trust the people you work for and the guests you invite into
your buildings, but if someone can access your network from outside of
your organisations sphere of control then they have free internet access
and you have no way to control them. If you implement guest WiFi access
then make sure that you apply the same levels of content filtering and
logging that you do on your wired network. If someone is intent on doing
something illegal using your network then any investigation is going to
end up on your doorstep. I don’t know a single company that would want
to be in that position. Ultimately this needs to be taken on board as
part of the standard risk assessment process, and the benefits of
offering this service may not be worth the investment required to
mitigate the threat of unauthorised or illegal use of the
infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="its-not-just-wifi-that-radiates">
<h2>It’s not just WiFi that radiates</h2>
<p>The points that I have addressed above are the biggest blind spots that
I have come across in my experience with corporate WiFi, but one that
still catches a lot of organisations out is all of the other things they
have that utilise radio. This kind of problem is one that the
intelligence services have been aware of for quite some time, which is
why you will never see a wireless keyboard and mouse in GCHQ. They have
invested time and money into both protecting themselves and being able
to intercept these kinds of signals from others. This kind of signals
intelligence is known to the outside world under it’s codename ‘Tempest’
and has been actively researched since the mid 1980’s.</p>
<p>I would have a hard time justifying to a client that they should adopt
‘tempest’ levels of emission control as most of them simply are not
under threat from actors who will use this level of sophistication,
however I have seen wireless technology deployed within critical
business functions where it simply was not needed.</p>
<p>An example of this would be in a service centre environment. The agents
in the service centre were delivering first contact support to the
entire organisation including authentication and access control
services. They are desk bound, and in fact cannot do their job if they
are away from their computer. These agents had recently had their phone
system upgraded and had all been given very nice looking wireless
headsets with which to take their calls. A brief look at these headsets
revealed that the protocol they were using to communicate with their
base stations was DECT, a standard that anyone with a wireless phone or
baby monitor would be familiar with. DECT can employ encryption of the
data stream, however since 2010 this has been rendered ineffective as
the team at deDECTed.org managed to reverse engineer the closed source
security algorithm in place so that the encryption key could be
recovered.</p>
<p>I mention the encryption here to ensure you understand that even with
encryption in place the content of these conversations cannot be
considered to be private, however in the case of the contact centre I
was investigating the data sheets for the device proudly stated that
encryption was not actually implemented. The data sheets were also very
proud of the range of the devices, boasting a 50m range within a
building and up to 200m outdoors using only the low power headset and
base station. This particular contact centre was well within 200m of a
public space with direct line of sight to the call handling agents
through the buildings windows. A small investment in a Com-On-Air PCMCIA
card and possibly a cheap directional antenna and someone could very
easily listen in on or record every phone call taking place, a treasure
trove of information for someone who wishes to do your organisation
harm.</p>
<p>In this case I strongly advised that they cease using this technology
and outlined the risks above, but I can’t really blame them for
implementing it in the first place. It’s my job to think evil things
about every piece of technology I come across, but the vast majority of
people who are involved in procurement and risk assessment don’t make
the connection between ‘wireless’ and ‘security’ unless they see the
WiFi logo somewhere on the box.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="its-all-about-risk">
<h2>It’s all about risk</h2>
<p>Technical security has been talked about a lot with regards to wireless
networking and wireless technologies but as I have demonstrated here
there are still a few blind spots that organisations need to address
when investigating any technology that comes with a radio in it. Utilise
your organisations security staff as part of the risk assessment process
and ensure that they are given the resources to keep their knowledge up
to date. If you are implementing anything using wireless technologies
and do not have the skills in house to assess the security implications
then invest in some external consultancy. This could save you a lot of
time and money compared to fixing an insecure implementation. This is a
problem that is not going to get any easier to deal with as radio
connectivity becomes more a part of every device we use.</p>
