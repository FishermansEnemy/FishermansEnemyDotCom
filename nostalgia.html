<div class="section" id="let-s-have-a-drink">
<h2>Let's have a drink</h2>
<p>A friend who I used to work with at RWE decided to organise a night out
for those of us who have recently left. It's been 6 months since I left
RWE after working there for 13 years and a lot of us who had been there
for similar lengths of time have left over the last year or so. I hadn't
seen these guys since I left so I was looking forward to catching up
with them and seeing how they're doing, and&nbsp;commiserating&nbsp;with those
that were still there and facing the axe.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/lIv96reVlAE">pint and three-quarters</a> in and we
were swapping war stories about life outside the old concrete monolith
that we'd worked in for so long and talk soon turned to how we'd all
ended up there.</p>
<p>I hadn't realised when I got the invite, but one of the guys who came
along I had known from my very first IT job back in 1994......</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-college-years">
<h2>The college years</h2>
<p>I was 17 and I had just left school the previous year. I was studying a
BTEC in IT fundamentals and applications at Halesowen&nbsp;college, life was
good and I still had hair. I hated school, I mean I really hated it and
I was so glad to finally be out from that toxic atmosphere. I was
finally studying what I was interested in with a bunch of nerds&nbsp;who were
mostly on the same wavelength. The course was heavy on programming,
maths and electronics and it was really fun to get my teeth into
something so interesting. Part of the course required that we do 2 weeks
of work experience with a real business, to help us prepare for the
realities of work I guess.</p>
<p>At this point I had worked nights at a petrol station just to get some
money to go out with. The fates had other ideas about that and the
petrol station was soon shut down and I was out of work. I figured if I
could find the right place to do my work experience I might be able to
turn it into a 2 week interview and get another job out of it. A job
that is actually in the field I was studying.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="icon-computers">
<h2>ICON computers</h2>
<p><img alt="Just pretend it's full of computers and not beds." src="http://fishermansenemy.com/images/ICON-300x147.png" /></p>
<p>The Dudley area wasn't exactly silicon valley so the opportunities to
work in IT for a 17-year-old at college weren't exactly vast and many.
My only realistic option was the large computer store that had recently
opened over on the Merry Hill waterfront. I make a phone call and speak
to the store manager Irfan and arrange to go in to speak to him. A short
interview later and I've got my work experience placement.</p>
<p>ICON was my first proper IT job and I quickly fell into the technical
support role. My mentor for those early years was a Andy Green, the
technical manager, and I credit him for giving me the time, resources
and knowledge that I needed to start on the path that I'm on today.</p>
<p>I clearly remember the first ever job I had to do at ICON. A customer
had brought a new hard drive from us, a whopping 150mb monster, and he
wanted us to fit it for him in his PC. I had *no* idea where to start.
We didn't have the internet back then so it was a case of reading the
badly translated Japanese manual, grabbing a screwdriver and seeing what
was what. After plugging in the IDE cable and power I switched the
machine on and.... DISK NOT FOUND. Crap, not only wasn't it seeing the
new disk but it couldn't see the old one either and the machine wouldn't
even boot. Andy sees what I'm doing and it's obvious that he's having
fun watching me think I've destroyed the customers computer. He gives me
a minute and then comes over and points to a pair of jumpers on the back
of the drive labelled &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot;. The penny drops, I move the
jumper on the new drive from &quot;Master&quot; to &quot;Slave&quot; and the machine boots
first time. This was probably one of the best lessons I could have had,
he let me have a go and only gave me just enough information so that I
could figure it out for myself. I learned so much from the time I spent
working for Andy and I'm sure that I wouldn't be where I am today
without the&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;he gave me in those early years.</p>
<p><img alt="SCREEEEE RRRRAAAAAW" src="http://fishermansenemy.com/images/coupler-300x225.jpg" /></p>
<p>Soon after I started at ICON a friend of mine from college mentioned
that he was also looking for a job. At the time the support department
was just Andy working full-time and me working on the weekend. We were
starting to get busier in the shop as the home computer market was
starting to take off in a big way. Windows 95 was just around the corner
and there had been a big marketing push by Microsoft. My friend came on
board to join me at the weekend and we hired 2 full-time guys to work
some of the week and the busy Saturdays. Mike was one of the full-time
guys we brought on and it was him who started me on this 20 year trip
down memory lane last night. I could fill a hundred blog posts about the
kind of stuff we got up to in those 18 months we were there, but suffice
to say we got to play with tons of cool stuff, such as the beast of an
acoustic coupler pictured above which we used to reach BBS's all over
the place. We also set up a 10base2 Novel network in the store, and used
it to play Doom. We got to see one of the first CD writers to come on
the market and I ended up getting an Apple Newton!</p>
<p><img alt="Massive in-joke. Check the ceiling next time you're buying a bed" src="http://fishermansenemy.com/images/pritt_stick_1447036c-300x187.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sadly this wasn't to last. Many smaller shops sprang up and a
combination of our location and the size of the store soon made it
impossible to compete. We all kept in touch after we went our&nbsp;separate
ways and some of us even ended up working together again. I made some
great friends in '94 who I'm still in contact with today, we socialised
together, chased girls in the local pubs and at least two of us met
our&nbsp;partners thanks to the friendships we made.</p>
<p>So thank you Mike for reminding me about the journey I've been on. Thank
you Irfan and Greg for giving me a chance. Thank you Andy for having the
patience to train me, and making sure I had the tools I needed to
continue to learn that I still use to this day. Thank you Neil for
putting up with my constant attempts at comedy for the past 25 years.
Thank you to all the people who have helped me as I moved from place to
place and gave me opportunities to grow and develop. I hope that I've
not let you down.</p>
