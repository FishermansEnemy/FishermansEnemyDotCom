on London getting blanketed by free <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/8997413/Europes-largest-free-Wi-Fi-zone-comes-to-London.html">WiFi
coverage</a>
courtesy of O2 and this got me thinking. If I were a bad guy this would
present me with such a very tasty target. Lots of tourists coming into
the city for the Olympics with all of their laptops, smart phones and
tables. All of them not wanting to spend huge amounts on 3G roaming but
thirsty for information and posting thousands of pics to Facebook and
twitter. Of course they are going to take advantage of this free
service, and so will the criminals.</p>
<p>In order to offer this service free of charge then security will always
take a back seat. After all the information flowing over the network
isn't O2's is it? They aren't going to give each user a certificate to
authenticate to the AP, and they aren't going to
configure&nbsp;everyone's&nbsp;device to verify the cert on the AP. I mean who are
we kidding, they aren't even going to implement WEP let alone WPA2. At
best it will be a captive portal so they can grab some nice info to sell
on to their advertising buddies.</p>
<p>So now you are in London, you've taken some photos, waved at the Queen
and taunted the guards outside Buckingham palace. You're ready to drop
it all of Facebook so you're friends know just how much better you are
than them. Time to connect to the free WiFi!</p>
<p>Open up your WiFi&nbsp;connection&nbsp;manager and there is &quot;London Free WiFi from
O2&quot; [OPEN], sweet.</p>
<p>Select the AP and&nbsp;voilà, IP address obtained and I'm all ready to go.</p>
<p>Open up Internet Explorer and I get a nice O2 registration page where
you can sign up for a free account or log on with an existing one. You
put in your name, address, date of birth, mothers maiden name email
address etc and are issued a default password. You don't bother changing
this, you just want to get on&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>Log into Facebook and post pics. Look at your friends posts and comment
&quot;lol&quot;. Isn't living in the future cool?</p>
<p>The above sounds like a plausible use case for most people in the city
and for most people they won't see anything wrong with it. After all,
they had to put in a password right, so it must be secure? Well, not so
much. You see, while the tourist was sitting down with their latte to
make their Facebook friends jealous, what actually was happening was
this.</p>
<p>A criminal sets themselves up in a high traffic area of the city,
probably near one of the sporting events. They fire up their laptop with
an ALFA AWUS051NH wireless network adapter and 5dBi antenna.They will
then fire up a copy of
<a class="reference external" href="http://wirelessdefence.org/Contents/KARMAMain.htm">Karma</a>. Now,
Karma is a very generous piece of code. It will listen on the WiFi card
and wait to hear other devices probing for access points. Usually when
and AP&nbsp;receives&nbsp;a broadcast for an SSID that it doesn't host it will
simply ignore it, but Karma will answer all probes with a positive and
allow the client to connect to it. Karma will then give the client and
access point and begin to handle traffic. At this point Karma shows its
generous nature again and will start answering requests for connections
on a large number of protocols such as SMTP and FTP, it will use these
connections to harvest the users credentials. If the criminal is
being&nbsp;particularly evil they will be running
<a class="reference external" href="http://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/wiki/Karmetasploit">Karmetasploit</a>&nbsp;to
automatically detect the software that you are using and start feeding
them backdoors and exploits, joining you to their botnet and saving your
machine to have more fun with later.</p>
<p>If the criminal is feeling generous he will connect himself to the
legitimate WiFi and route your traffic onwards so you can actually surf,
and he can steal even more credentials.</p>
<p>So how do you get around this? is there a way to use this service
safely? If you want to give yourself a level of privacy while using a
public network then your only real option is to connect via VPN to
another trusted network and run all of your traffic through that. You
are still exposed to having your credentials harvested between
establishing connection to the network and establishing connection to
the VPN, but if you are careful and make sure there are no apps that are
going to attempt to connect as soon as they have a valid network then
you should be&nbsp;OK. Also, make sure your anti-virus is up to date, but DO
THAT AT HOME! you will see why in a bit.</p>
<p>If your smart phone supports VPN's then it should be safe to use them as
well, if not then either don't use it, or use 3G. Check
out&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://openvpn.net/">openVPN</a>&nbsp;to set up a service at your home
that you can connect back to.</p>
<p>On the subject of software that will try to connect as soon as it gets a
connection, it's not just email apps that will do this. If you have
Java, Acrobat, Flash or a host of other apps installed then they will
attempt to connect back to their mothership and download updates. If our
criminal is being very evil he will also be running
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.infobytesec.com/down/isr-evilgrade-Readme.txt">evilgrade</a>.
Evilgrade is like Karma but for updates, it will intercept traffic and
look for software calling home for updates. When it finds one it will
intercept the connection and send the computer malware instead of the
updates it was expecting. Welcome to the criminals botnet. The only
defence is to make sure you are using a VPN but you will still be
exposed to attack before you have established the connection or if it
drops out for any reason. <a class="reference external" href="http://practicalrambler.blogspot.com/2011/01/windows-7-firewall-how-to-always-use.html">This
article</a>
give some details on some third-party software you could use to help
with this.</p>
<p>Everything that I have said above applies just the same to using any
public network, but I contest that this combination of such a large
public network with so many foreign tourists who will not want to use 3G
due to costs makes this a golden opportunity for information thieves. So
spread the word, make sure that your friends and family understand the
risks, and as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/InfosecCynic">&#64;j4vv4d</a>
would say, &quot;Stay secure my friends&quot;.</p>
