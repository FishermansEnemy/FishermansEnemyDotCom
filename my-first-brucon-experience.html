            <p><img alt="BruCON logo" src="http://blog.rootshell.be/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Brucon-logo-small.jpg" />I've been back from BruCON for a couple of days now so I
think it's about time I put my thoughts in order and write up my
experience of going to this awesome event.</p>
<p>After playing musical platforms at Brussels airport train station and
finally getting to the hotel at about 22:00 most people would probably
hit the sack to make sure they are bright eyed and bushy tailed for the
high technology to follow the next day. Not the BruCON crowd however. I
arrived too late to make it to sushicon at the Kabuki
Japanese&nbsp;restaurant, but a quick check of the #brucon hashtag on twitter
and the horde was located in the&nbsp;Delirium&nbsp; cafe in central Brussels. A
couple of us were checking in at the same time so we left the hotel
together and brave the Brussels public transport system. This Sunday was
a little special in Brussels as it was the annual &quot;No Car Day&quot; where
cars are banned from the city and public transport is free. The Brussels
public transport system isn't the easiest in the world to understand,
but at least we didn't have to figure out what ticket to buy, and google
maps told us what station and stops that we needed. Onwards!</p>
<p>After getting of the tram we made our way to&nbsp;Delirium to try and find
the hackers. Normally this wouldn't be hard as we are quite a unique
bunch, however your standard Brussels pub go'er tends to be the dressed
in black with lots of tatto's variety, at least where we ended up.
Luckily for us I spotted the&nbsp;distinctive beard of &#64;BaconZombie at the
bar, and from there we were good to go. Now, here are some tips for
anyone doing this next year. Number one, stick to the &quot;lighter&quot; Belgian
ales that are less than 5%. Number two, if you fail number one then at
least don't drink the stronger ones out of a glass boot. Number three,
if numbers one and two have gone by the wayside then at least don't do
number two twice. Finally although hanging round with Jimmy Blake, Dan
Kaminsky, BaconZombie (I never did get his real name) and a bunch of
other hackers that came be to called #beardcon is a lot of fun, perhaps
staying out until 4am isn't the best idea in the world, even if you do
and up hugging Dan Kaminsky. Also, normal people go to these pubs as
well and when they ask you why you are here, they tend to take it badly
when you point out the crowd you are with is here for a week long
hacking conference.</p>
<p>A couple of hours sleep later and I am on the bus to the con, thankful
that transport has been provided and I can postpone thinking about stuff
for a little while longer. Another tip, Brussels traffic is <em>insane</em>&nbsp;and
if you can avoid driving I recommend it. The Belgian highway code seems
to be a document that not many people have actually read. Thankfully if
you do need to get around the public transport system is quite good, and
there is a train from the Gare Du Midi where the hotel is to Etterbeek
station just outside the event. Registration went quite fast and I
picked up my active RFID badge and headed downstairs for 0xCOFFEE and
pastries. Feeling more human it was time to head upstairs for the
keynote. At this point it is probably worth pointing out another tip,
the workshop tracks have to be booked in advance if you would like to
attend them. I don't know if there was supposed to be an email go out to
attendees about this but I never got one, so when saturday came round
and I looked at the website to plan my event I found that most of the
workshops were already full. Because of this I missed out on the
Lockpicking workshop by TOOOL NL and the web&nbsp;application&nbsp;hacking
toolchain by Jason Haddix.</p>
<p>Although this was a pain, it was actually helpful in the end as in my
rush to get the bus I had left my painkillers at the hotel, and the one
or two cracked ribs that I am nursing from a cycling accident last week
were starting to become a problem I couldn't ignore. I head back to the
hotel by train and pick them up, along with some red bull and I am back
in time for the end of lunch.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WNXP2eEZSdg/TAKBPWK3RpI/AAAAAAAAAq0/8HELxdE-mLo/s1600/Lightning+Talks+Brucon+2.png" />After lunch came the lightning talks for day one. Anyone can
talk about anything they like, with or without slides, for 5 minutes.
There were quite a few takers, including how to pick up chicks at the
after party, featuring WickedClown and BaconZombie as test subjects.
This was basically a primer on social engineering techniques. If I
manage to get to BruCON next year then &nbsp;I will&nbsp;definitely think about
doing some of my own research and presenting it on stage. It is a great
opportunity to practice your public speaking.</p>
<p>After the lighting talks came the first workshop that I had signed up
for. Now, this is probably my only complaint about the conference so
far. The workshop was titled &quot;Hacking your conference badge - Open AMD&quot;
and was by the people who were running the conference RFID tracking
system and built the conference badges. As this was the only information
available I went along with &#64;ydoow&nbsp;expecting this to be a hands on
workshop where we could mod our badges and do some cool hardware
hacking. It wasn't. It was a 15 minutes description and a hour and a
half lecture on the impact of positional tracking on privacy. Now, this
is a subject that I am interested in, however none of there has any
reason to expect that this was the nature of the workshop and if I had
known I would have probably gond to see the presentations on the main
track instead, or done the WiFi malware workshop.</p>
<p>Worksop over, and it was time to get some dinner. It was a bit of a
crush in the food lines, but there was a nice choice of difference pasta
to fuel you through the conference. There was plenty of drinks on offer
to keep you hydrated and I decided to stay away from the the beer and
drink the Club-Mate instead. If you've never tried it then you should
take the opportunity if it comes up. It's a naturally&nbsp;caffeinated iced
tea type drink made from a south american plant and the hacker con
beverage of choice. At 20mg/100ml it's about 2/3 the strength of Red
Bull but is much lower in sugar, and the natural&nbsp;caffeine is much easier
on the metabolism than the extracted stuff in other energy drinks.</p>
<p>After dinner it was time for &quot;Pentesting high security environments&quot; by
Joe McCray and Chris Gates. A great talk about the dreaded APT and how
current pen testing techniques are not going to protect you if someone
is out to get you. Look for the video when it's posted up, this is well
worht watching.</p>
<p>The final presentation of the day was one that really hot home with me.
This was Abusing locality in shared hosting environments, a talk about
how a shared web hosting services exposes all of the customers sites
hosted on the same server to each other. It boils down to the fact that
each server may be hosting several hundred sites on the same OS and
software. Even though file system permissions are in place to stop
customers being able to read and write in each others area the software
that runs the web apps, like PHP, use a shared resource and a single
account to maintain state information. You can exploit this as you are
able to read other sites session data and force them to use state data
that you have written to the shared store to authenticate you on their
site. This also allows you to elevate&nbsp;privileges. I am now looking at
how much it will cost to move fishermansenemy.com to a dedicated host so
I don't have to worry about the 1300 other sites on this server coming
after me!</p>
<p>That was it for day one, a lot of people went of to the IOActive after
party at the Havana Club, but I needed my sleep so decided to call it a
day. Reports from the party go'ers were that it was &quot;off the hook&quot;, and
from the the videos I saw (&quot;Dan Kaminsky doing the Dan Kaminsky dance&quot;)
I agree with them! If I manage to get their next year I'll pace myself a
bit better on day one so I've got the energy to make it.</p>
<div class="section" id="day-2">
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Waiting in the hotel lobby on day 2 you can tell by those that have got
up in time for the bus that the party the night before was quite the
event. There were a few faces missing but most people made it to the
first presentation and day 2 started with a bang. Ian Amit started of
day 2 with &quot;Pushing in, leaving a present and pulling out without
anybody noticing&quot; a great talk about data exfiltration techniques where
traditional methods of getting your data out are not available. The
lesson that I took away from this was that if an attacker gets in then
all the DLP in the world won't stop your data leaving. My favorite
techniques were encrypting the data and printing it out on an internal
printer, then waiting for the &quot;corrupted prints&quot; to be thrown own and
simply lifting them from the dumpster. Taking over a MFD and faxing the
data out via the pstn, and my number one favorite, converting the data
to a sound file with a script written by Ian and then phoning it out to
a google voice mailbox, or answer phone that the attacker controls.
Proper bad ass spy stuff!</p>
<p>Next talk was a history of Botnets and how they are using browsers for
c&amp;c and information stealing by Aditya K Sood. I won't try and&nbsp;summarise
it here as I would not be able to do it justice however it is well worth
watching when the video is available.</p>
<p>Time for lunch, and I found myself eating a hotdog with &#64;ydoow,
&#64;digininja, Chris John Riley, Dan Kaminsky and a few others. We ended up
talking about the breaking news that researchers were going
to&nbsp;announce&nbsp;at a security conference in Buenos Aires next week that they
had a practical attack on SSL and TLS v1.1 and below. After a lot of
back and forth Dan came up with a convincing technique that they might
be using, I am eagerly awaiting the announcement to see how close we
were to the actual attack. This was one of the highlights of the
conference for me as you hardly ever get to talk shop like that with the
luminaries of the security profession and get to take part in the kind
of brainstorming from which cool new hacks are born. I could do that all
day.</p>
<p>After lunch we had a great introduction to Social Engineering and
becoming a human lie detector by Dale Pearson, again I won't try
and&nbsp;summarise here as I Dale did a stand up job of explaining this
subject, and you should check out the video when it becomes available.
After Dale we had Jack Jones talking about myth busting the notions that
most of us have about Risk Management. Once again I could not do this
justice on here but Jack did a great job of explaining exactly why what
we think of as&nbsp;impossibilities in properly measuring risk are really
not, and we can do a proper measured analysis of risk and use it to
drive action in the organisations that we work in. WATCH IT.</p>
<p>The last presentation of the conference was Alexander Polyakov and
Dmitry Chastuhin discussing vulnerabilities in the SAP J2EE Engine. This
was interesting to me as my company uses a lot of SAP and the java J2EE
engine is something I have never had chance to get into. The technical
content was great, and the slides mixed humor and data in a way you come
to expect from these conferences. The only let down was that the
speakers did not seem to be well prepared and the demos didn't work at
all. A little more polish and preparation would have made all the
difference.</p>
<p>This closed out day 2 for me as I had a flight booked back that night,
so my last tip would be to sta over the night of the last day if you can
to make sure you can get to all of the presentations. I missed out on
the lighting talks on day 2 which was a shame as I really wanted to see
Tomasz Miklas talk about SPAM pinning, and the 99 cent heart surgeon
dilema by Stefan Friedli.</p>
<p>My first experience of bruCON is one that I will always remember, and I
cannot stress how valuable it was to be able to socialise and talk with
all of the infosec superstars that you only normally get to interact
with over twitter. Hopefully I'll see you there next year, and if you're
in the UK you should check out BSides London 2012 coming up next April.</p>
