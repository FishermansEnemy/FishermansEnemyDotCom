<p>I'm currently sat waiting to finish the PA-QSA course and take my exam.
I should probably be studying a little more, but I've memorised the
standard with a memory palace technique that I used for PCI-DSS so I
recon I should be fine.</p>
<p>San Francisco is the first American city I've been in so the only
comparisons I have are with large UK and european cities, but even so it
seems to be very unique. It has the hustle and bustle that you'd expect
from somewhere like London but everyone here seems to be a little more
relaxed about life. The area around the Moscone center where RSA 2013 is
being held is your typical conference district that you could find
anywhere, but a few blocks walk from there you can find some of the
worst poverty and homelessness that I have ever encountered. I'm not
sure if it was because the RSA circus was in town but getting a hotel
within a block or two of Moscone will cost you an arm and a leg. I
managed to get a&nbsp;relatively cheap hotel only about 4 blocks from Union
Square and Moscone, and even though the hotel itself is quite nice the
streets around it are littered with people sleeping rough along with
open drug use and people who are clearly in need of help with regards to
their mental health. Those of you who know me might think I'm making a
joke about this, I'm not. It's something that as an outsider really
makes you consider how something like this comes about and where the
people of the city are putting their priorities when something like this
is just accepted as being the way things are.</p>

<p>Anyway, now I've bummed you all out I'll move to&nbsp;the more exiting parts
of my visit. I'm actually in town to do my PA-QSA certification however
as the flights at a weekend are half the price of the same flight in the
week I ended up with some time on my hands. I decided to sign up for
BSides SF and I'm really glad I did. I'm not going to write a point by
point review of the talks as I believe that 99% of them were recorded,
so go online and watch them. One that I really did enjoy was on physical
pen testing by Valerie Thomas. She gave a very interesting presentation
on the vast amount of recon you can do with simple to use open source
data sources, and the kind of stupid things you can do to bypass a
variety of access control&nbsp;mechanisms.</p>
<p>After lunch on day 2 I decided to take a break from the main tracks and
have a play in the locksport room. They had just run a competition where
about 30 attendees got to try and escape from handcuffs live on stage
with a bit of training given by the experts. Pretty much all the people
who got up managed to get the cuffs off in under 10 seconds, so I
thought to myself, I'm having some of that!</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_346&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130225_135700.jpg"><img alt="Ian in handcuffs" src="http://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130225_135700-300x225.jpg" /></a> Ian in handcuffs[/caption]</p>
<p>The locksport guys provided a range of picks and practice locks as well
as a few examples of typical law enforcement style handcuffs. After a
couple of minutes instruction I got myself cuffed up and managed to shim
the cuffs and get them off in about 5 seconds. It was way easier than it
should be, although as it was pointed out to me there are ways of
cuffing the hands together to make it harder, but not impossible, to do
this kind of escape.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_342&quot; align=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130225_153104.jpg"><img alt="A collection of locks and picks at BSides SF." src="http://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130225_153104-300x225.jpg" /></a> A collection of locks and
picks at BSides SF.[/caption]</p>
<p>After I'd perfected the shim technique they took us through how to pick
the cuffs using a pick or bobby pin through the keyway. This also
included picking cuffs that had been &quot;double locked&quot; so that the
shimming technique would not work. Now, that is a lot harder than
shimming but with an hour or so of practice I was getting pretty good at
it. So, if anyone is stuck for a birthday present for me then a nice set
of <strong>Law Enforcement</strong> grade cuffs would be grand :)</p>
<p>Now, if you've watched the Twitters then I'm sure you would have heard
about the controversy surrounding &#64;violetblue's talk, and the fact that
it was pulled at short notice. I'll let Violet tell the story in her
<a class="reference external" href="http://violetblue.tumblr.com/post/44107008572/what-happened-with-my-security-bsides-talk">own
words</a>,
as all I heard was a bit of conversation while I was being cuffed by
Twitters head of security. If what Violet says is true then I have
personally lost all respect in the ADA initiatives goals. Feel free to
try to help people take part in the community, but do not try to censor
hackers, we really don't like it.</p>

<p>After all that excitement I decided to take a tourist day before I was
locked in a room with a bunch of auditors for 2 days. I had a walk
around the various Piers near&nbsp;Fisherman's&nbsp;[STRIKEOUT:Enemy]Wharf and
took a trip out to Alcatraz Island. I'm glad I did as the ranger guided
tour along with the audio tour of the cell blocks was&nbsp;fascinating. If
you want a breathtaking view of downtown San Francisco then there are
very few to beat the one from the prison block on the top of Alcatraz.</p>
