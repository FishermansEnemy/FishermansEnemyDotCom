            <p>Ever since I got my Yubikey I've been a big fan of making sure my many
web application accounts are as secure as possible. Thanks to services
like <a class="reference external" href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> you can now keep up unique
complex passwords on every account you own with very little extra
effort.</p>
<p>So, in this spirit I decided to change my &quot;My 3&quot; account password at
Three.co.uk. I fire up the random password generator and create a nice
large random string. I take the string and feed it into their change
password&nbsp;dialogue&nbsp;only to be told that only passwords less than 12
characters will be allowed. This backwards thinking is common is a lot
of web applications, usually because of very bad design decisions made
by the developer when it came to managing user authentication. A lot of
times it is the indicator that passwords are stored without hashing.</p>
<p>On small web apps you should probably note this and make sure that you
don't use them if you value your security, however this app was one that
I had to use and this password policy and it's worrying implications
were holding my mobile phone records so I was not going to let this go.
I sent the following tweet to &#64;threeuksupport yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="https://hootsuite.com/dashboard#">#fail</a><em>&#64;</em><a class="reference external" href="https://hootsuite.com/dashboard#">ThreeUK</a><em>&#64;</em><a class="reference external" href="https://hootsuite.com/dashboard#">ThreeUKSupport</a>&nbsp;&quot;Your
new password can not be greater than 12 characters in length&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Very soon they got back to me and a number of my followers that also
happened to be customers saying that they would pass this to the
security team and get a response back. This is actually pretty unusual
for companies like this, as they mostly like brushing things like this
under the carpet.</p>
<p>This morning the few of us that raised this got an email response from
Three, Included below in the email they sent and my in-line reply.</p>

 Hi there,

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 Following the discussions on Twitter regarding My3 passwords, I've
 spoken with our security team and they've advised of the following:

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 - Passwords obviously need to be stored in a database.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>No, passwords should *never* be stored. They should be salted with a
unique value per user and hashed with a computationally expensive
algorithm.</p>
</div><div><div></div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 To prevent threats from things like SQL Injection, it is necessary
 to limit the password length so that Hackers cannot enter lengthy
 SQL statements (as passwords) to try and retrieve data from the
 database, corrupt it, or use Cross Site Scripting techniques by
 entering Javascript etc in input fields.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>SQL Injection and XSS are defeated by proper input and output
validation, not restricting the length of users passwords. This is a
basic premise of securing web applications.</p>
</div><div><div></div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 - Most people find passwords hard to remember. This is compounded
 when the password policy mandates that it must contain a combination
 of letters and numbers.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>Does this mean that you *don't* mandate alpha-numeric passwords?</p>
</div><div><div></div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 To help ensure passwords are more memorable, and to reduce calls
 into the contact centre relating to forgotten passwords and locked
 accounts, the policy has been set such that a minimum of 7 & maximum
 of 12 characters is supported.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>How does stopping a user from using a 13 character password prevent the
user from forgetting it? At least you can admit that your goal with this
policy is to reduce customer support calls. This is easily mitigated by
having a robust automated password re-set mechanism as used on thousands
of other web applications. Small sites like ebay and paypal.</p>
</div><div><div></div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 Passwords longer than 12 characters are no more ‘secure’ but are
 significantly more likely to not be remembered or miss typed.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>Forgotten an mis-typed yes, &quot;less secure&quot; You could not be more wrong.
Please tell me how you arrived at the conclusion that passwords length
does not impact on the security of the users account</p>
</div><div><div></div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 Password security is largely a factor of the user’s choice of
 password. Something that is memorable to the user will always have
 the potential to be ‘guessed’ by another person through possible
 social engineering techniques etc.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 If a password is longer than 12 characters, a user is more likely to
 have to write it down somewhere.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>So you are arguing that a long password would be written down, therefore
only exposed to a local physical security breach, so we'll make sure
they *can't* have a long password and then they'll only be exposed to
every phishing site, keylogger and brute forcer on the planet? How does
that make any sense? You position&nbsp;acknowledges&nbsp;that short memorable
passwords are insecure (something you denied in a previous paragraph)
yet you decide that the best position for you is to mandate them?</p>
</div><div><div></div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    <div>

 - It could be argued that 12 characters is a little restrictive.
 However, the reference to the recent Linked-in miss management of
 passwords, some might say is an irrelevance in relation to limiting
 the maximum password length to 12 characters. On this note, non of
 the passwords are stored in clear text form.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>You need to look at the Linkedin breach and answer this again. At least
Linkedin hashed their passwords, but without a salt and a CPU expensive
algorithm the passwords were recovered for the vast majority within a
few hours. First to fall were the dictionary words, so tell me again why
you are limiting used to small passwords that are easy to remember?</p>

 While we obviously have a duty of care over customer data, but we
 also have to find the balance between protecting this data and
 usability.

 .. raw:: html

    </div>

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div></div></div><div><p>You do have a duty of care over customer data, I'm glad that you realise
that. With the recent exposure of phone infrastructure hacking from NI
and other journalists I would have hoped that you realised that you hold
the very private and personal data of a vast number of individuals who
expect you to at least abide by industry best practice when it comes to
securing access to it. If I were a high profile individual then this
response from a national mobile infrastructure company then I would be
very concerned about people who wish me harm gaining access to my call
records.</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>Here is the reply from Three UK</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" align="left"><p>Hi Ian</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="left"></div><div dir="ltr" align="left"><p>I've raised your further email with our security team.&nbsp; They've
advised that they're unable to enter into further discussion with
you regarding our technical details on how wwe manage and store user
credentials.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="left"></div><div dir="ltr" align="left"><p>In doing so, would only be a security risk in itself.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="left"></div><div dir="ltr" align="left"><p>Our website clearly states &quot;Your password must be at least 7
characters long and must contain at least one number and one letter&quot;
and we do enforce these contraints.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="left"></div><div dir="ltr" align="left"><p>Please take this as our final response on the matter.&nbsp; I hope you
understand the reasons why we're unable to go in to any further
security specifics with yourself.</p>
</div><div dir="ltr" align="left"><p>Thanks</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So there we have it, I shouldn't worry my pretty little head about it
and we if we told you what we actually do to secure your data the entire
planet would explode. Draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>I guess I shouldn't worry that they've got a new interface to My 3 in
beta&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;to all users going on right now. I bet that thing is
tight as drum.</p>
