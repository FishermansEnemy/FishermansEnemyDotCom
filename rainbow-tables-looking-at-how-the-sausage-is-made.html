            <p>It's been a while since I posted, so I thought I'd put up something that
has been bothering me for a &nbsp;long time, and isn't about bulbs ;)</p>
<p>Every security pro knows what a rainbow table is, at least they think
they do. I was certainly in that position until I really started looking
at them as part of my GPEN revision. From the material we had and the
questions asked it class it still was not clear how exactly we make sure
that our tables contain all of the possible&nbsp;permutations&nbsp;of passwords in
the key space we are looking to recover from. I put some feelers out to
a very knowledgeable bunch of people on a mailing list I am a member of
and it was clear by the fact that I only got one reply that most infosec
pros are quite happy to use the technology as long as they don't have to
understand how it really, really works.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mission-mission-pig-faced.jpg"><img alt="image0" src="https://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mission-mission-pig-faced-300x225.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hand reared organic pork, only the best cuts and no filler&quot;</em></p>
<p>Rainbow tables are easy right? We just use our massive computers to
pre-calculate all these lame unsalted hashes and record them in a file,
and then when we have a hash to crack we just look it up in the file and
presto, we have the password. No, that's wrong, stop telling people
that. If it were that simple we would have been doing this decades ago.
The big issue with this is the space required to store all the
pre-computed hashes. In the above model a table of hashes and passwords
covering the Alpha-Numeric with Special Character key space would
contain 7.5 x 10^12 pairs, totalling 112TB. You can download a table to
do the above key space for LANMAN hashes with a 99.9% chance of success
that is less than 1GB. How on earth can that work?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tumblr_l2a7s8pHPg1qzfnxco1_500.jpg"><img alt="image1" src="https://fishermansenemy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tumblr_l2a7s8pHPg1qzfnxco1_500-300x225.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>&quot;Right Lisa, some wonderful,&nbsp;*magical animal</em>!&quot;
*</p>
<p>You'll no doubt have noticed the 99.9% figure quoted above, it was what
got my head down in the rabbit hole in the first place. You see, rainbow
tables are a product of <strong>*deep dark maths*</strong> and they get their special
powers by the fact that there is an element of randomness used in their
creation. This is where people like me without a doctorate in
mathematics, start to have to trust the what the people who do have one
say about this process. On a very basic level rainbow tables work by
reducing by an order of magnitude the amount of computation a system has
to do in order to determine the password that is associated with a
particular hash.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-get-from-112tb-to-1gb">
<h2>How to get from 112TB to &lt;1GB</h2>
<p>Instead of storing every password:hash pair in a lookup table, rainbow
tables only store the start condition and end condition of a chain of
reduction functions. These chains of functions can be any length
although they are usually in the order of tens of thousands of
calculations long. The longer a chain is the more work the cracking
computer has to do to determine the password. This means it takes longer
to crack a hash but the table size is smaller, and this is the trade off
we have to make to have tables of a reasonable size that can still
recover passwords in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-reduction-functions">
<h2>What are reduction functions?</h2>
<p>A reduction function is similar to a hash function in that it takes an
input and generates an output. However it the output it produces must be
compatible with the key space we are looking to crack as its output is
then used by the hash function we are generating a table for to generate
another hash, clear so far? How about an example?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-chain">
<h2>Example chain</h2>
<p>Starting password: F1shermans3n3my</p>
<p>Reduction function R(1) just takes the first 8 characters of the input
hash</p>
<p>Reduction function R(2) takes the second 8 characters of the input hash</p>
<p>Reduction function R(3) takes the first 8 characters XOR'ed with the
second 8</p>
<p>F1shermans3n3my -&gt; MD5 -&gt;&nbsp;197286d6790a825d9776919ab1308457</p>
<p>197286d6790a825d9776919ab1308457 -&gt; R(1) -&gt; 197286d6</p>
<p>197286d6 -&gt; MD5 -&gt;&nbsp;414e28158cfc944ef733df37e6a4c4e7</p>
<p>414e28158cfc944ef733df37e6a4c4e7 -&gt; R(2) -&gt;&nbsp;8cfc944e</p>
<p>8cfc944e -&gt; MD5 -&gt;&nbsp;853fdffc3878b857c686f43265c27768</p>
<p>853fdffc3878b857c686f43265c27768 -&gt; R(3) -&gt;&nbsp;BD4767AB</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Now these are just functions I pulled out of my... hat, and it is not
suggested that they are good&nbsp;reduction&nbsp;functions&nbsp;to use when generating
chains. As the chain is being generated the reduction functions cycle
through again and again until the chain has been generated of the
required length. The <strong>*deep dark maths*</strong> makes sure that these
functions always return a value that is compatible with the&nbsp;desired&nbsp;key
space and &nbsp;password&nbsp;length to be recovered, and that after a certain
number of&nbsp;iterations&nbsp;will have returned a certain percentage of the
total key space. This is the point that was not clearly explained in the
material on SEC560 and made me look into this in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-about-start-points">
<h2>A note about start points</h2>
<p>The initial passwords that are used to start the chains need to be
selected, and you can either generate them randomly or&nbsp;sequentially, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.project-rainbowcrack.com/file_format.htm">this post</a> for
more on this. Also it has been&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that you can generate them with
<a class="reference external" href="http://sites.google.com/site/reusablesec2/drcrack">dictionary
words</a>(Thanks
Farhan).</p>
<p>At the end of all this hashing and reducing we save our disk space by
throwing almost all of it away. Stay with me though, it'll make sense
later. We store only the start password and the end password. We then
start another chain with a different initial password and rotate our
reduction functions by one so that in the example above we would start
with R(2) then R(3) and then back to R(1)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chain 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chain 2</p>
<p>Initial Password &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Initial Password</p>
<p>Reduction Fn 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reduction Fn 2</p>
<p>Reduction Fn 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reduction Fn 3</p>
<p>Reduction Fn 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reduction Fn 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the rainbow? I bet you thought it was a drug reference didn't you?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="so-how-does-all-this-help-us-recover-passwords">
<h2>So how does all this help us recover passwords?</h2>
<p>So far we've done a lot of maths and thrown most of it away, and I bet
you're wondering how this has in any way made recovering passwords
easier. The trick comes with the steps used to lookup data in the
tables. First take the hash you want to crack create a chain using the
same reduction functions that were used to generate the tables. Then
take all of the passwords that the reduction functions generated and see
if they match the end password of any of our generated chains. Once you
have found a chain that contains one of the passwords our chain has
generated then you know that because we are using the same reduction
functions that somewhere in that chain is the password:hash pair that we
want to recover. You then re-create that chain checking at every step to
see if a hash function generates the hash that we are cracking. Once it
does you go back to the output of the previous reduction function and
you have your password. The total computing load for cracking involves
creating only one chain, a series of lookups to a small (millions
usually) number of end passwords, and a partial generation of a further
chain. This is orders of magnitude faster than running through the
entire key space manually. The slowest part of this is looking up the
chain end passwords as the tables are usually too large to fit in memory
and you are relying on slow disk I/O.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="am-i-satisified-now">
<h2>Am I satisified now?</h2>
<p>Well I got my question answered and I think I now really do understand
how these small tables can cover the huge key space that is required to
do this kind of lookup. However just like with cryptography it's never a
pleasant feeling to have to resign yourself to just <em>trust the maths</em>. I
doubt I'll ever get a PhD in mathematics so I'll have to do just that.</p>
<p>This post is mostly just an exercise for myself as I usually learn
things better if I write them down, and there are other resources out
there that go into the mathematics behind this if you have the
background to understand it. Also I can recommend the SEC560 course to
anyone who is interested in penetration testing, so don't be put off by
this post as rainbow tables covers only 13 slides in the 6 day course,
and I have had no issues understanding the rest of it! I'm 99% sure I've
got this down now, but my reduction functions are overloaded
with&nbsp;Tonsillitis and pain killers so if anyone can see any glaring
mistakes then feel free to tell me where I'm wrong so I can correct it.
The last thing I want is for this post to be mis-information&nbsp;&nbsp;on an
already confused subject.</p>
